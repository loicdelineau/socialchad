# socialchad
Are you not into consuming brainrot on social media? 

Socialchad isn't either.

He lives in a bash shell and only consumes the 
finest GNU-standard unformatted .txt content.

His job is to query all the largest offenders of brainrot pollution on
our planet through their APIs and to programmatically dump 
your unformatted content in each of their
highly stylized post templates.

Doing so, socialchad offers you a standard format in which you can write
all your social media posts, a format that respects the key principles 
behind Richard Stallman's philosophy and most importantly, 
one that is designed to be edited in vim!

## 1. How to bring the chad along with you?
For the chad to help you through life, you will need to give him 
one-time access to your bashrc, clone this repo and run :

```
./guide-me-chad
```

Don't forget, the chad doesn't touch any proprietary OS, it will only
work on system running a linux distro using apt as its package manager.

## 2. What can the chad do for you?
### 2.0. man page
Like any respectable chad, socialchad will gently guide you if you 
forget how to use it, simply call one of the following commands :

```
socialchad
man socialchad
socialchad -h
socialchad --help
```

To bring up a list of helpful reminders of what the chad can you do for you.

### 2.1. Handle recon
To be effective on social media, you need a common handle across
the different platforms, the chad knows this perfectly well and 
he will parse all the
standard URLs to check if they are available for you to claim.

All you need to do is to whisper him a handle:    

```
socialchad handle
```

### 2.2. Template 
The chad will gently remind you what kind of template he expects to use. 

### 2.3. Chad-social 
The only social media the chad uses is the terminal, running:

```
socialchad chadsocial
```

Will generate a social media post formatted for display in the terminal. 
Earthlings use this to preview the posts that socialchad will make
on their various "mainstream" brainrot social platforms. 

### 2.4. AutoPost 
Socialchad will programmatically post on all your social medias simultaneously.

```
socialchad autopost
```

## 9. How to part ways with chad?
There is no reason to do this but as a respectable chad, socialchad
has prepared a way for you to disinstall him and clean your system of 
all his rizz, running :

```
./get-lost-chad
```

Will promptly go through all your files and remove anything that was
added or changed by the chad.
